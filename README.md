# Challenge #4 — The Evil Manager and the Long Form

## Smart Trick Used:

Instead of manually writing 20 input fields and individual validations,
I used a fields configuration array to dynamically render inputs and run all validation logic through one generic function.

## Benefits:

- Faster development time ⏱️

- Clean, reusable code 🧼

- Easy to maintain or scale 🧱

- Demonstrates problem-solving and UI/UX thinking 💡
