# Challenge #4 — The Evil Manager and the Long Form

## Smart Trick Used:

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

Instead of manually writing 20 input fields and individual validations,
I used a fields configuration array to dynamically render inputs and run all validation logic through one generic function.

## Benefits:

- Faster development time ⏱️

-- Clean, reusable code 🧼

-- Easy to maintain or scale 🧱

-- Demonstrates problem-solving and UI/UX thinking 💡
